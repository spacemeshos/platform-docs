The protocol implements a decentralized ledger (a DAG structure, known as the <em>mesh</em>) with a native cryptocurrency (Smesh, also known as SMH) that anyone is free to mine and transact. What’s more, the protocol is designed in such a way that anyone with free hard drive space and a stable Internet connection can mine from home (by running the <a href="https://github.com/spacemeshos/smapp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spacemesh App</a>) and earn guaranteed rewards in the form of SMH coin, a process known as Smeshing in <a href="https://github.com/spacemeshos/testnet-guide/blob/master/dict.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spacemesh terminology</a>.</p><p>Spacemesh research and development is led by a team of full-time contributors employed by the <a href="https://spacemesh.io/faq/#governance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spacemesh development company</a>. However, Spacemesh is also an active open source project and a community of dedicated researchers, developers, and other contributors around the world. Learn more about the Spacemesh protocol at the <a href="https://spacemesh.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project homepage</a>, and about the project and its goals in the <a href="https://spacemesh.io/spacemesh-manifesto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">manifesto</a>.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="spacemesh-basics"></a>Spacemesh basics<a class="hash-link" href="#spacemesh-basics" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>In Spacemesh, we divide time into fixed-length units we call <em>layers,</em> which are further grouped together into longer intervals called <em>epochs.</em> Layers are similar to Bitcoin&#x27;s average ten minute block time, with a couple of important differences. For one thing, unlike in Proof of Work-based blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum where block time is the product of a Poisson process and thus random, layers in Spacemesh occur at precisely fixed intervals of time. This is due to the deterministic nature of the Spacemesh protocol. For another thing, in Spacemesh, many blocks are produced in each layer rather than only a single block. (Formally, a layer in Spacemesh is defined as a set of blocks produced during a fixed time interval, i.e., the layer is the blocks, not the time interval.)</p><p>Read on to learn more about the details of the Spacemesh protocol. You may also find this high-level <a href="https://spacemesh.io/protocol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">protocol overview</a> helpful.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="why-race-free"></a>Why race-free?<a class="hash-link" href="#why-race-free" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>The Spacemesh protocol guarantees that each Smesher that follows the rules of the protocol is eligible to produce multiple blocks during each epoch. Note also that Smeshing is entirely permissionless: in other words, <em>anyone who runs the Spacemesh software and follows the rules of the protocol is guaranteed to be rewarded with Smesh coins at each epoch.</em> This is in contrast to both Proof of Work-based protocols, such as Bitcoin, where rewards are probabilistic and only professional miners and mining pools stand a realistic chance of earning them; as well as to Proof of Stake-based protocols, where one must hold a substantial amount of the token before they are eligible to participate and earn rewards.</p><p>Spacemesh is able to achieve this nice property due to certain unique characteristics of its <a href="https://spacemesh.io/protocol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">consensus mechanism</a> (see also <a href="/docs/protocol/consensus/overview">Consensus</a>): in particular, the fact that it’s race-free, i.e., it does not require Smeshers to compete to produce blocks in a given layer, but rather allows many blocks to be produced at each layer. This results in a DAG data structure rather than a chain. See <a href="https://spacemesh.io/race-freeness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The race to race-free (or why we chose mesh over chain)</a> for more information on this design choice.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="core-infrastructure"></a>Core Infrastructure<a class="hash-link" href="#core-infrastructure" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Spacemesh infrastructure consists of several distinct core components. These components are built and maintained separately, but work in concert to enable the broader Spacemesh network and ecosystem.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="go-spacemesh"></a>Go-spacemesh<a class="hash-link" href="#go-spacemesh" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>The largest and most complex component of the network infrastructure is the go-spacemesh full node implementation. This codebase implements the bulk of the Spacemesh core protocol and can be used to run a protocol-compatible full node on a variety of different systems and architectures, including a trustless <em>full node</em> that independently verifies each transaction, and a mining (Smeshing, in <a href="https://github.com/spacemeshos/testnet-guide/blob/master/dict.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spacemesh terminology</a>) node that additionally participates in consensus, produces blocks and collects rewards.</p><p>As the name implies, go-spacemesh is written in the Go programming language, and consists of a number of different modules that implement core components of the protocol such as mining, consensus, networking, P2P sync, and state. See <a href="https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">go-spacemesh</a> for more, in particular <a href="https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh#go-spacemesh-architecture" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Go-spacemesh Architecture</a>.</p><p>Note that, unlike full node implementations for certain other blockchain protocols, go-spacemesh does not include wallet functionality.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="poet-server"></a>PoET server<a class="hash-link" href="#poet-server" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>PoET stands for “Proof of Elapsed Time.” It’s a core part of the Spacemesh <a href="/docs/protocol/consensus/overview">consensus protocol</a>, where it’s used to prove that a miner has allocated a chunk of hard drive space to the protocol <em>for some period of time.</em> PoST, <a href="#post">described below</a>, is used to prove that <em>space</em> has been allocated; PoET is responsible for the <em>time</em> component of space-time.</p><p>PoET is implemented as a web service, separate from go-spacemesh, that anyone can run and offer as a service to Smeshers. Many Smeshers can share a single PoET server, and one Smesher may opt to utilize multiple PoET servers for redundancy. Go-spacemesh <a href="https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh/blob/develop/activation/poet.go" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">includes code</a> to communicate with a PoET server.</p><p>For more information see <a href="/docs/protocol/mining/poet">PoET</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/spacemeshos/poet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PoET codebase</a>.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="spacemesh-app"></a>Spacemesh App<a class="hash-link" href="#spacemesh-app" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>The Spacemesh App is a GUI-based desktop application built for Windows, Mac, and Linux that has two main functions: it acts as a wallet, allowing a user to hold and transact <a href="https://github.com/spacemeshos/testnet-guide/blob/master/dict.md#smesh-smh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smesh coin</a>, and it allows a user to mine (known as <a href="https://github.com/spacemeshos/testnet-guide/blob/master/dict.md#smesher" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smeshing</a>) by allocating a certain amount of hard drive space, constructing and submitting eligibility proofs, producing blocks, and collecting rewards.</p><p>The App runs an instance of the go-spacemesh full node under the hood. For more information see the <a href="https://github.com/spacemeshos/smapp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spacemesh App codebase</a>.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="testing"></a>Testing<a class="hash-link" href="#testing" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Testing is a critical part of the software development workflow across all of the independent components of the Spacemesh network. There is no single, universal test suite; rather, each component implements its own unit and integration tests. For instance, you can find the go-spacemesh tests inside the <a href="https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh/tree/develop/tests" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>tests/</code> folder</a> of the repository.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="devops"></a>DevOps<a class="hash-link" href="#devops" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>The only piece of infrastructure that’s strictly required to join the Spacemesh network is a copy of the go-spacemesh client (along with the Spacemesh App if Smeshing). However, running multiple clients (such as setting up a local network, or a dev testnet), and/or ensuring redundancy among these nodes, requires additional tooling. There is tooling to run a <a href="https://github.com/spacemeshos/local-testnet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">local testnet</a>, to <a href="https://github.com/spacemeshos/smops" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">operate multiple nodes</a>, and to <a href="https://github.com/spacemeshos/collector" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">collect events</a> and store them in a database.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="svm"></a>SVM<a class="hash-link" href="#svm" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>SVM is the Spacemesh Virtual Machine, a WebAssembly-compatible smart contract engine. This project is experimental and aims to add smart contract functionality to a <a href="https://github.com/spacemeshos/product/blob/master/product_plan.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">future protocol release</a>. Note that, since it is not part of the testnet, SVM <em>is not covered further</em> in the rest of these documents at present. See <a href="https://github.com/spacemeshos/svm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the repository</a> and <a href="https://spacemesh.io/svm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this blog post</a> for more information about SVM.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="mining"></a>Mining<a class="hash-link" href="#mining" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><a name="post"></a>### Proof of Space-time<p>In Spacemesh, a miner establishes eligibility to produce blocks and participate in <a href="/docs/protocol/consensus/overview">consensus</a> by publishing an <a href="/docs/protocol/mining/activations">Activation Transaction (ATX)</a>, which contains (among other things) a <a href="/docs/protocol/mining/post">Proof of Space-time</a>.</p><p>These proofs have two phases. In the initial phase, known as the <em>initialization phase,</em> a miner allocates a chunk of hard drive space to the protocol, and commits to the contents of that space. The space is filled with cryptographic junk such that for the duration that this space is committed to Spacemesh it cannot be used for any other purpose. This hard drive space is the <em>space</em> component of the <em>space-time</em> resource that underlies a Proof of Space-time.</p><p>In the ongoing phase, known as the <em>execution phase,</em> the miner must submit a new ATX containing a proof of ongoing eligibility each epoch.</p><p>See <a href="/docs/protocol/mining/overview">Mining</a> for more information on how these proofs are generated and utilized.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="producing-blocks"></a>Producing blocks<a class="hash-link" href="#producing-blocks" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Once a miner has successfully generated and submitted an eligibility proof, the process of actually producing blocks is relatively straightforward. The miner can calculate which layers in a given epoch they are eligible to produce blocks. (The number of layers during which they are eligible, and thus, the number of blocks they produce in each epoch, will vary depending upon the total number of miners, but the epoch size is set sufficiently large that, unless the number of miners becomes enormous, each miner will be eligible to produce multiple blocks per epoch.)</p><p>Miners collect transactions into a local transaction pool, and once per eligible layer they assemble them into blocks and broadcast those blocks to the network. See <a href="/docs/protocol/mining/overview">Mining</a> for more information on this process.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="consensus"></a>Consensus<a class="hash-link" href="#consensus" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Consensus in the Spacemesh protocol consists of several independent components that work together to allow each network node to independently arrive at the same canonical view of blocks and transactions in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Byzantine Fault Tolerant-fashion</a>, i.e., even if those nodes haven&#x27;t seen precisely the same information at precisely the same time. What follows is a very brief overview; see <a href="/docs/protocol/consensus/overview">Consensus</a> for more information.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="tortoise-and-hare"></a>Tortoise and Hare<a class="hash-link" href="#tortoise-and-hare" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Once many miners have produced candidate blocks for a given layer, how does the network achieve consensus on the canonical set of blocks and transactions that form the layer? In other words, how does a transaction become finalized?</p><p>Spacemesh employs a two-step process to achieve finality. The first step is the Hare protocol, which each node runs at the end of every layer. It’s a Byzantine agreement protocol that allows the network to quickly achieve consensus on a canonical set of blocks. The output of the Hare allows bootstrapping of the consensus of the Tortoise, which is a slower, vote-based protocol that methodically counts the votes for and against each block, leading to eventual, final consistency. Each node uses the output of the Hare protocol to decide which previous blocks its newly-produced blocks should vote for. See <a href="/docs/protocol/consensus/overview">Consensus</a> for more information on these protocols.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="networking"></a>Networking<a class="hash-link" href="#networking" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>The Spacemesh network consists of a peer-to-peer network of independent nodes, each running go-spacemesh (or another Spacemesh protocol client). Messages, which may consist of new transactions, old or new blocks, votes on consensus, etc., transit the network in one of only two fashions: a message may be transmitted from one node directly to a recipient node (e.g., in response to a request for a particular piece of data, such as a block), or a message may be gossiped across the entire network (e.g., a new transaction or block).</p><p>For more information, see <a href="/docs/protocol/p2p/overview">P2P Networking</a>.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="data-structures"></a>Data Structures<a class="hash-link" href="#data-structures" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>The basic building blocks of the Spacemesh protocol, and the overall, canonical mesh data structure, are transactions and blocks. Transactions are account-based, and contain a sender, a recipient, an amount, a signature, and a few other pieces of data. Blocks collate zero or more transactions into a discrete set, and contain a block height (layer number), a signature of the miner, a proof of eligibility, and a few other pieces of data. See <a href="/docs/protocol/mining/overview">Mining</a> for more information.</p><p>Other relevant data structures include the various types of proof produced and submitted by miners and other services (<a href="/docs/protocol/mining/poet">PoET</a>, <a href="/docs/protocol/mining/activations">ATX</a>), and vote messages exchanged as part of the <a href="/docs/protocol/consensus/overview#hare">Hare protocol</a>.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="learn-more"></a>Learn More<a class="hash-link" href="#learn-more" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>The documents contained in this repository are intended to provide a high-level, developer-centric overview of the Spacemesh protocol and the various infrastructure that implements the protocol.

You can chat with other Spacemesh core developers and app developers <a href="https://gitter.im/spacemesh-os/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on Gitter</a>, or join a regular core devs call (participation information will be shared soon).</p></div></article><div class="margin-vert--xl"><div class="row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/spacemeshos/platform-docs/blob/main/versioned_docs/version-0.1.0/protocol/overview.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><svg fill="currentColor" height="1.2em" width="1.2em" preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet" role="img" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_2_ui" aria-label="Edit page"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col text--right"><em><small>Last updated on <time datetime="2021-03-09T19:07:34.000Z" class="lastUpdatedDate_1WI_">3/9/2021</time> by <strong>Aviv Eyal</strong></small></em></div></div></div><div class="margin-vert--lg"><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"></div></nav></div></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_35-E thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#introduction" class="table-of-contents__link">Introduction</a></li><li><a href="#intended-audience" class="table-of-contents__link">Intended audience</a></li><li><a href="#repository-contents" class="table-of-contents__link">Repository Contents</a><ul><li><a href="#hare-protocol" class="table-of-contents__link">Hare Protocol</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#what-is-spacemesh" class="table-of-contents__link">What is Spacemesh?</a><ul><li><a href="#spacemesh-basics" class="table-of-contents__link">Spacemesh basics</a></li><li><a href="#why-race-free" class="table-of-contents__link">Why race-free?</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#core-infrastructure" class="table-of-contents__link">Core Infrastructure</a><ul><li><a href="#go-spacemesh" class="table-of-contents__link">Go-spacemesh</a></li><li><a href="#poet-server" class="table-of-contents__link">PoET server</a></li><li><a href="#spacemesh-app" class="table-of-contents__link">Spacemesh App</a></li><li><a href="#testing" class="table-of-contents__link">Testing</a></li><li><a href="#devops" class="table-of-contents__link">DevOps</a></li><li><a href="#svm" class="table-of-contents__link">SVM</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#mining" class="table-of-contents__link">Mining</a><ul><li><a href="#producing-blocks" class="table-of-contents__link">Producing blocks</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#consensus" class="table-of-contents__link">Consensus</a><ul><li><a href="#tortoise-and-hare" class="table-of-contents__link">Tortoise and Hare</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#networking" class="table-of-contents__link">Networking</a></li><li><a href="#data-structures" class="table-of-contents__link">Data Structures</a></li><li><a href="#learn-more" class="table-of-contents__link">Learn More</a></li><li><a href="#contribute" class="table-of-contents__link">Contribute</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><h4 class="footer__title">Explore</h4><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://spacemesh.io/testnet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Testnet</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://spacemesh.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Web</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><h4 class="footer__title">Community</h4><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="http://chat.spacemesh.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Discord</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://twitter.com/teamspacemesh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Twitter</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><h4 class="footer__title">More</h4><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/spacemeshos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">GitHub</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2022 Spacemesh.
