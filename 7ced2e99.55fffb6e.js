Please check my answer to Q11. Generally, as long as dishonest leader is picked to lead - he can stall the consensus by one iteration. Since we assume half are honest we expect two iterations as I explained. On the other hand, if we tolerate f dishonest and there are f+1 or more (no matter if f is 1/3, 1/4 or 1/2 etc) then the assumptions are broken, nothing is guaranteed and you can end up with non consistent sets on termination or not terminate at all."))}u.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
